🔷 What is Cloudflare?
Cloudflare is a global network platform that provides services like:

Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Web security (DDoS protection, WAF)

DNS (Domain Name System)

Performance optimization

Zero Trust networking

Bot management

SSL/TLS encryption

In simple terms, it sits between a website and the user, acting like a smart security and speed booster.

🔧 Why Do Companies Use Cloudflare?
✅ 1. DDoS Protection
Stops hackers from overloading the website with traffic (called Distributed Denial of Service attacks).

Cloudflare absorbs this malicious traffic in its massive global network.

✅ 2. Website Performance (CDN)
Cloudflare caches content and delivers it from servers close to the user (using its 200+ data centers).

Improves load time and reduces server load.

✅ 3. Global DNS Network
Offers one of the fastest DNS services.

Reduces DNS lookup times.

✅ 4. Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Blocks malicious requests like SQL injection, XSS, etc.

Protects websites from known vulnerabilities.

✅ 5. SSL/TLS Encryption
Instantly provides free HTTPS using SSL certificates.

Builds trust with users and improves SEO.

✅ 6. Bot Protection
Detects and blocks bad bots.

Allows useful bots like Google, Bing.

✅ 7. Load Balancing
Helps distribute traffic across multiple servers.

Keeps the website online even if one server fails.

✅ 8. Zero Trust Security for Teams
For internal apps, it verifies every user and device before access (Zero Trust).

Useful for remote teams and secure internal tools.

🛠️ How Cloudflare Works (Simplified)
User sends a request to a website (e.g., example.com).

DNS is managed by Cloudflare → Request is routed to the nearest Cloudflare data center.

Cloudflare:

Checks for cached version → If available, serves it immediately.

If not cached, it forwards the request to the origin server.

Adds security headers, compresses content, and monitors for attacks.

Cloudflare returns optimized and secure response to the user.
